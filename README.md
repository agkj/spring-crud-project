# spring-crud-project

Motivation(s):
This project is an improved version of the previous database management in my repository and it seeks to implement a CRUD web-based database management system through the use of Spring Framework dependencies but with persistent data.

Using dependencies such as: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring MySql Driver and Thymeleaf are used to facilitate the interaction between the backend in Java and frontend HTML. In addition, using Spring restful api's to implement HTTP methods to update the database that is stored in MySQL.

To start:
Ensure that in the properties file that your username and password matches the one that you have set in MySQL workbench.
