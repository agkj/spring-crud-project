# spring-crud-project

Motivation(s):
This project seeks to implement a CRUD web-based database management system through the use of Spring Framework dependencies. 

Using dependencies such as: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring MySql Driver and Thymeleaf are used to facilitate the interaction between the backend in Java and frontend HTML. In addition, using Spring restful api's to implement HTTP methods to update the database that is stored in MySQL.

This project differs from the previous spring projects that are in my repository as it is persistant.
